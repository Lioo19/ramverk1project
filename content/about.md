About
=========================

Welcome to the very core of the GameQ site

This site exists to answer all your questions about Games, regardless if you play board, computer, card or console.

This project is a part of the examination of Ramverk1, a course given by Blekinge Institute of Technology, and is created by Linn√©a Olofsson.

GameQ is built in PHP, The Anax Framwork and using a SQLite-database.

If you're curious about the code, it can be accessed from [github](https://github.com/Lioo19/ramverk1project)
